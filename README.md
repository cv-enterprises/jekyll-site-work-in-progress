# CV Enterprises
jekyll site - moving the old site over to Jekyll for future ease of use

## To-Do's:
- [x] CHANGE PASSWORDS
- [x] fix favicon
- [x] get custom domain from Porkbun
- [x] set up custom emails (such as neato@cventerprises.org) with improvmx
- [x] [Verify org on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/verifying-your-organizations-domain) âœ“
- [ ] Set up wildcard SSL on Porkbun to support added custom domains to projects (for example, tutor.cventerprises.org works but throws a privacy message because the SSL is only set up on cventerprises.org, not *.cventerprises.org)
  - [ ] [Tutor Matching](https://github.com/VikramChilkunda/tutormatching) - tutor.cventerprises.org
  - [ ] [Community Service Logger](https://github.com/Conbonbot/Community_Service_Logger) - community.cventerprises.org?
  - [ ] [Locker Registration](https://github.com/lyronctk/CVHS_lockers) - lockers.cventerprises.org?
  - [ ] others
- [ ] automated fork/mirror updater that clones repos of projects on the site, ideally with a list of (Project Name)(link)
