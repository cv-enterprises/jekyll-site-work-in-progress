jekyll site - moving the old site over to Jekyll for future ease of use

Everything has been automated, all that students will need to interface with is markdown files in the _portfolio folder.

The website is done, everything is pretty much finalized except for the modals aka portfolio project pages. These could use some work but should be easy to change with some basic Bootstrap and HTML knowledge. 

#### notes:
- color of logo: #36aeff (usinf as highlight color)

- could make an automated fork/mirror updater that clones repos of projects on the site, ideally with a list of (Project Name)(link) ?

- To-do's are in the Projects tab
